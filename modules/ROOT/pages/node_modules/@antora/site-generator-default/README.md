This is the default site generator pipeline for Antora.
This pipeline is invoked by the `generate` command of Antora's CLI to produce and publish static documentation sites.

Its site generator pipeline aggregates documents from versioned content repositories and processes them using [Asciidoctor](https://asciidoctor.org).
