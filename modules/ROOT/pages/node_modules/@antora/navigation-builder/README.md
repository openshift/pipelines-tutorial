# Antora Navigation Builder

The Navigation Builder is a component in Antora responsible for building a navigation catalog sourced from navigation files.
This navigation catalog can be used to add site navigation to pages in an Antora documentation pipeline.

[Antora](https://antora.org) is a modular static site generator designed for creating documentation sites from AsciiDoc documents.
Its site generator pipeline aggregates documents from versioned content repositories and processes them using [Asciidoctor](https://asciidoctor.org).
