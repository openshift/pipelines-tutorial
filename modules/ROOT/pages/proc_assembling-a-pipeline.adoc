= Assembling a pipeline

A `Pipeline` represents a CI/CD flow and is defined by the `Tasks` to be executed.  It specifies how the `Tasks` interact with each other and their order of execution using the `inputs` , `outputs`, and the `run-After` parameters. It is designed to be generic and reusable in multiple applications and environments.

For this tutorial, create a `Pipeline` that takes the source code of the Spring PetClinic application from GitHub, builds the application, and deploys it on OpenShift as outlined below:

== Procedure

. Copy the contents of the following sample `Pipeline` YAML file and save it:
+
----
apiVersion: tekton.dev/v1alpha1
kind: Pipeline
metadata:
  name: deploy-pipeline
spec:
  resources:
  - name: app-git
    type: git
  - name: app-image
    type: image
  tasks:
  - name: build
    taskRef:
      name: s2i-java-8
    params:
      - name: TLSVERIFY
        value: "false"
    resources:
      inputs:
      - name: source
        resource: app-git
      outputs:
      - name: image
        resource: app-image
  - name: deploy
    taskRef:
      name: openshift-client
    runAfter:
      - build
    params:
    - name: ARGS
      value: "rollout latest spring-petclinic"
----
+
This `Pipeline` performs the following tasks:

* Clones the source code of the application from a Git repository (app-git resource).
* Builds the container image using the S2I task which generates a Dockerfile for the application and uses Buildah to build an image.
* The application image is then pushed to an image registry (app-image resource).
* The new application image is deployed on OpenShift using the OpenShift-CLI.
+
Note that, the `Pipeline` YAML file contains no references to the PetClinic Git repository and its image in the registry. These are defined in the `PipelineResources`.
+
`Pipeline` s in Tekton are designed to be generic and re-usable across environments and stages through the applications lifecycle. They abstract away the specifics of the Git source repository and image registries to be used during `Pipeline` execution.
+
The tasks execution order is determined based on the dependencies that are defined between the tasks using the  `inputs` and `outputs` parameters, and the explicit orders that are defined using `runAfter`.

. Create the `Pipeline`:
+
----
oc create -f deploy-pipeline.yaml
----
+
. Verify that the `Pipeline` has been added to the application as follows:
+
----
$ tkn pipeline ls
NAME             AGE             LAST RUN   STARTED   DURATION   STATUS
build-pipeline   8 seconds ago   ---        ---       ---        ---
