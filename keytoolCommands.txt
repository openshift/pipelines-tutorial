Create a private key.
  openssl genrsa -des3 -out ISDEV.key 2048
  enter the passphrase for your easy remembrance
 
Create a certificate signing request (CSR).
  openssl req -new -key ISDEV.key -out ISDEV.csr
  Fill all the details and enter the passphrase entered above
 
Sign the CSR yourself and create a certificate.(This is a self signed certificate so you need to sign it yourself and in real world example you need to send it to CA to sign)

openssl x509 -req -days 365 -in ISDEV.csr -signkey ISDEV.key -out ISDEV.crt
 enter the details and passphrase
 
Integration server understands DER format so convert the crt received from CA to DER format

openssl x509 -in ISDEV.crt -inform PEM -out ISDEV.crt -outform DER

If you want to create a new keystore create one this is the recommended approach and not sure the default keystore. You can use the default keystore for Dev servers not recommended for prod

openssl pkcs12 -export -des3 -in ISDEV.crt -inkey ISDEV.key -out ISDEV.pkcs12

to view all the certificates created in unix run it as ls -l in windows use dir

Install the certificate in Integration Server

Install the keystore via Security - Keystore - Create Keystore Alias on ISâ€™s web frontend.

create all the details mentioned in that screen and once saved you should be able to see the keystore in enabled format
